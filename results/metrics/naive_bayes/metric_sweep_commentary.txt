Macro-F1 curves show moderate gap indicating balanced bias-variance, with test performance struggling to exceed random-baseline macro-F1. The model degrades as the train fraction grows, hinting at instability (Î”=-0.079). Inductive bias: High-bias generative model with strong independence assumptions, generally low variance. The gap narrows as training size increases, indicating improved regularization.
