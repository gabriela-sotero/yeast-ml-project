Macro-F1 curves show pronounced train-test gap signalling high variance, with test performance solid but improvable macro-F1. The model benefits markedly from additional training data (Î”=0.257). Inductive bias: Ensemble of decorrelated trees that reduces variance via averaging. The gap narrows as training size increases, indicating improved regularization.
